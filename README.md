The Test Tool extension extends the standard test tool in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central with the following features.

- Select the Run field for:
    -	all tests
    -	only failing tests and thus disabling all others
    -	non failing tests, thus disabling failing tests
- Deselect the Run field for all tests, thus disabling all tests
- ShortcutKey = 'Ctrl+F9' on "Run Selected"
