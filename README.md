# Test Tool Extension

The Test Tool extension extends the standard test tool in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central with the following features.

- Select the Run field for:
    -	all tests
    -	only failing tests and thus disabling all others
    -	non failing tests, thus disabling failing tests
- Deselect the Run field for all tests, thus disabling all tests

You might have come here via my new book __Automated Testing in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central__, published by, Packt, expecting to find the code of this extension. Unfortunately the book took so much time I wasn't able to get Test Tool Extension completed and published here. But it will be very soon.
