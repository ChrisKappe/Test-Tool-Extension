# Test Tool Extension

The Test Tool extension extends the standard test tool in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central with the following features.

- Select the Run field for:
    -	all tests
    -	only failing tests and thus disabling all others
    -	non failing tests, thus disabling failing tests
- Deselect the Run field for all tests, thus disabling all tests
- Set ShortcutKey = 'Ctrl+F9' on "Run Selected"

You might have come here via my new book __Automated Testing in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central__, published by, Packt. Feel frre to use the extension and source to your own need. Would be fantastic if any adjustments you think are useful are shared be reporting it ad an issue here.
